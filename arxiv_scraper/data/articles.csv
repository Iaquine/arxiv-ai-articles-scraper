Enhancing Visual Inspection Capability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models on Medical Time Series with Supportive Conformalized and Interpretable Small Specialized Models,"Huayu Li, Xiwen Chen, Ci Zhang, Stuart F. Quan, William D.S. Killgore, Shu-Fen Wung, Chen X. Chen, Geng Yuan, Jin Lu, Ao Li","Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in visual inspection of medical time-series data, achieving proficiency comparable to human clinicians. However, their broad scope limits domain-specific precision, and proprietary weights hinder fine-tuning for specialized datasets. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) excel in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning required for complex clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a decision-support SSM that integrates seamlessly with LLMs. By using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify clinically significant signal segments and conformal prediction for calibrated set-valued outputs, ConMIL enhances LLMs' interpretative capabilities for medical time-series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ConMIL significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as ChatGPT4.0 and Qwen2-VL-7B. Specifically, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision for confident samples in arrhythmia detection and sleep staging, compared to standalone LLM accuracy of 46.13% and 13.16%. These findings highlight the potential of ConMIL to bridge task-specific precision and broader contextual reasoning, enabling more reliable and interpretable AI-driven clinical decision support.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16215,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
From Informal to Formal -- Incorporating and Evaluating LLMs on Natural Language Requirements to Verifiable Formal Proofs,"Jialun Cao, Yaojie Lu, Meiziniu Li, Haoyang Ma, Haokun Li, Mengda He, Cheng Wen, Le Sun, Hongyu Zhang, Shengchao Qin, Shing-Chi Cheung, Cong Tian","Abstract:The research in AI-based formal mathematical reasoning has shown an unstoppable growth trend. These studies have excelled in mathematical competitions like IMO, showing significant progress. However, these studies intertwined multiple skills simultaneously, i.e., problem-solving, reasoning, and writing formal specifications, making it hard to precisely identify the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in each task. This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and decomposes it into six sub-tasks. We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five mainstream formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) in six formal-verification-related tasks by distilling GPT-4o. They are split into a 14k+ fine-tuning dataset FM-alpaca and a 4k benchmark FM-Bench. We found that LLMs are good at writing proof segments when given either the code, or the detailed description of proof steps. Also, the fine-tuning brought about a nearly threefold improvement at most. Interestingly, we observed that fine-tuning with formal data also enhances mathematics, reasoning, and coding abilities. We hope our findings inspire further research. Fine-tuned models are released to facilitate subsequent studies",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16207,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)

Sager, Benjamin Meyer, Peng Yan, Rebekka von Wartburg-Kottler, Layan Etaiwi, Aref Enayati, Gabriel Nobel, Ahmed Abdulkadir, Benjamin F. Grewe, Thilo Stadelmann","Abstract:Instruction-based computer control agents (CCAs) execute complex action sequences on personal computers or mobile devices to fulfill tasks using the same graphical user interfaces as a human user would, provided instructions in natural language. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of instruction-based computer control, examining available agents -- their taxonomy, development, and respective resources -- and emphasizing the shift from manually designed, specialized agents to leveraging foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We formalize the problem and establish a taxonomy of the field to analyze agents from three perspectives: (a) the environment perspective, analyzing computer environments; (b) the interaction perspective, describing observations spaces (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action spaces (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions, executable code); and (c) the agent perspective, focusing on the core principle of how an agent acts and learns to act. Our framework encompasses both specialized and foundation agents, facilitating their comparative analysis and revealing how prior solutions in specialized agents, such as an environment learning step, can guide the development of more capable foundation agents. Additionally, we review current CCA datasets and CCA evaluation methods and outline the challenges to deploying such agents in a productive setting. In total, we review and classify 86 CCAs and 33 related datasets. By highlighting trends, limitations, and future research directions, this work presents a comprehensive foundation to obtain a broad understanding of the field and push its future development.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16150,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Flexible Blood Glucose Control: Offline Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback,"Harry Emerson, Sam Gordon James, Matthew Guy, Ryan McConville","Abstract:Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated success in automating insulin dosing in simulated type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients but is currently unable to incorporate patient expertise and preference. This work introduces PAINT (Preference Adaptation for INsulin control in T1D), an original RL framework for learning flexible insulin dosing policies from patient records. PAINT employs a sketch-based approach for reward learning, where past data is annotated with a continuous reward signal to reflect patient's desired outcomes. Labelled data trains a reward model, informing the actions of a novel safety-constrained offline RL algorithm, designed to restrict actions to a safe strategy and enable preference tuning via a sliding scale. In-silico evaluation shows PAINT achieves common glucose goals through simple labelling of desired states, reducing glycaemic risk by 15% over a commercial benchmark. Action labelling can also be used to incorporate patient expertise, demonstrating an ability to pre-empt meals (+10% time-in-range post-meal) and address certain device errors (-1.6% variance post-error) with patient guidance. These results hold under realistic conditions, including limited samples, labelling errors, and intra-patient variability. This work illustrates PAINT's potential in real-world T1D management and more broadly any tasks requiring rapid and precise preference learning under safety constraints.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15972,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Are Transformers Able to Reason by Connecting Separated Knowledge in Training Data?,"Yutong Yin, Zhaoran Wang","Abstract:Humans exhibit remarkable compositional reasoning by integrating knowledge from various sources. For example, if someone learns ( B = f(A) ) from one source and ( C = g(B) ) from another, they can deduce ( C=g(B)=g(f(A)) ) even without encountering ( ABC ) together, showcasing the generalization ability of human intelligence. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, ""FTCT"" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15857,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Harnessing Diverse Perspectives: A Multi-Agent Framework for Enhanced Error Detection in Knowledge Graphs,"Yu Li, Yi Huang, Guilin Qi, Junlan Feng, Nan Hu, Songlin Zhai, Haohan Xue, Yongrui Chen, Ruoyan Shen, Tongtong Wu","Abstract:Knowledge graphs are widely used in industrial applications, making error detection crucial for ensuring the reliability of downstream applications. Existing error detection methods often fail to effectively leverage fine-grained subgraph information and rely solely on fixed graph structures, while also lacking transparency in their decision-making processes, which results in suboptimal detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent framework for Knowledge Graph Error Detection (MAKGED) that utilizes multiple large language models (LLMs) in a collaborative setting. By concatenating fine-grained, bidirectional subgraph embeddings with LLM-based query embeddings during training, our framework integrates these representations to produce four specialized agents. These agents utilize subgraph information from different dimensions to engage in multi-round discussions, thereby improving error detection accuracy and ensuring a transparent decision-making process. Extensive experiments on FB15K and WN18RR demonstrate that MAKGED outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of KG evaluation. For specific industrial scenarios, our framework can facilitate the training of specialized agents using domain-specific knowledge graphs for error detection, which highlights the potential industrial application value of our framework.

LLM-powered Multi-agent Framework for Goal-oriented Learning in Intelligent Tutoring System,"Tianfu Wang, Yi Zhan, Jianxun Lian, Zhengyu Hu, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Qi Zhang, Xing Xie, Hui Xiong","Abstract:Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have revolutionized education by offering personalized learning experiences. However, as goal-oriented learning, which emphasizes efficiently achieving specific objectives, becomes increasingly important in professional contexts, existing ITSs often struggle to deliver this type of targeted learning experience. In this paper, we propose GenMentor, an LLM-powered multi-agent framework designed to deliver goal-oriented, personalized learning within ITS. GenMentor begins by accurately mapping learners' goals to required skills using a fine-tuned LLM trained on a custom goal-to-skill dataset. After identifying the skill gap, it schedules an efficient learning path using an evolving optimization approach, driven by a comprehensive and dynamic profile of learners' multifaceted status. Additionally, GenMentor tailors learning content with an exploration-drafting-integration mechanism to align with individual learner needs. Extensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate GenMentor's effectiveness in learning guidance and content quality. Furthermore, we have deployed it in practice and also implemented it as an application. Practical human study with professional learners further highlights its effectiveness in goal alignment and resource targeting, leading to enhanced personalization.

Propositional Interpretability in Artificial Intelligence,David J. Chalmers,"Abstract:Mechanistic interpretability is the program of explaining what AI systems are doing in terms of their internal mechanisms. I analyze some aspects of the program, along with setting out some concrete challenges and assessing progress to date. I argue for the importance of propositional interpretability, which involves interpreting a system's mechanisms and behavior in terms of propositional attitudes: attitudes (such as belief, desire, or subjective probability) to propositions (e.g. the proposition that it is hot outside). Propositional attitudes are the central way that we interpret and explain human beings and they are likely to be central in AI too. A central challenge is what I call thought logging: creating systems that log all of the relevant propositional attitudes in an AI system over time. I examine currently popular methods of interpretability (such as probing, sparse auto-encoders, and chain of thought methods) as well as philosophical methods of interpretation (including those grounded in psychosemantics) to assess their strengths and weaknesses as methods of propositional interpretability.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15740,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Rethinking External Slow-Thinking: From Snowball Errors to Probability of Correct Reasoning,"Zeyu Gan, Yun Liao, Yong Liu","Abstract:Test-time scaling, which is also often referred to as slow-thinking, has been demonstrated to enhance multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, despite its widespread utilization, the mechanisms underlying slow-thinking methods remain poorly understood. This paper explores the mechanisms of external slow-thinking from a theoretical standpoint. We begin by examining the snowball error effect within the LLM reasoning process and connect it to the likelihood of correct reasoning using information theory. Building on this, we show that external slow-thinking methods can be interpreted as strategies to mitigate the error probability. We further provide a comparative analysis of popular external slow-thinking approaches, ranging from simple to complex, highlighting their differences and interrelationships. Our findings suggest that the efficacy of these methods is not primarily determined by the specific framework employed, and that expanding the search scope or the model's internal reasoning capacity may yield more sustained improvements in the long term.

Expert-Free Online Transfer Learning in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,Alberto Castagna,"Abstract:Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables an intelligent agent to optimise its performance in a task by continuously taking action from an observed state and receiving a feedback from the environment in form of rewards. RL typically uses tables or linear approximators to map state-action tuples that maximises the reward. Combining RL with deep neural networks (DRL) significantly increases its scalability and enables it to address more complex problems than before. However, DRL also inherits downsides from both RL and deep learning. Despite DRL improves generalisation across similar state-action pairs when compared to simpler RL policy representations like tabular methods, it still requires the agent to adequately explore the state-action space. Additionally, deep methods require more training data, with the volume of data escalating with the complexity and size of the neural network. As a result, deep RL requires a long time to collect enough agent-environment samples and to successfully learn the underlying policy. Furthermore, often even a slight alteration to the task invalidates any previous acquired knowledge. To address these shortcomings, Transfer Learning (TL) has been introduced, which enables the use of external knowledge from other tasks or agents to enhance a learning process. The goal of TL is to reduce the learning complexity for an agent dealing with an unfamiliar task by simplifying the exploration process. This is achieved by lowering the amount of new information required by its learning model, resulting in a reduced overall convergence time...",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15495,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)

A Neurosymbolic Framework for Geometric Reduction of Binary Forms,"Ilias Kotsireas, Tony Shaska","Abstract:This paper compares Julia reduction and hyperbolic reduction with the aim of finding equivalent binary forms with minimal coefficients. We demonstrate that hyperbolic reduction generally outperforms Julia reduction, particularly in the cases of sextics and decimics, though neither method guarantees achieving the minimal form. We further propose an additional shift and scaling to approximate the minimal form more closely. Finally, we introduce a machine learning framework to identify optimal transformations that minimize the heights of binary forms. This study provides new insights into the geometry and algebra of binary forms and highlights the potential of AI in advancing symbolic computation and reduction techniques. The findings, supported by extensive computational experiments, lay the groundwork for hybrid approaches that integrate traditional reduction methods with data-driven techniques.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15404,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion,"Guanglin Niu, Xiaowei Zhang","Abstract:Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to address the critical issue of missing knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) for their better applications. However, both the previous MMGKC and negative sampling (NS) approaches ignore the employment of multimodal information to generate diverse and high-quality negative triples from various semantic levels and hardness levels, thereby limiting the effectiveness of training MMKGC models. Thus, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling (DHNS) scheme tailored for MMKGC tasks, which tackles the challenge of generating high-quality negative triples by leveraging a Diffusion-based Hierarchical Embedding Generation (DiffHEG) that progressively conditions on entities and relations as well as multimodal semantics. Furthermore, we develop a Negative Triple-Adaptive Training (NTAT) strategy that dynamically adjusts training margins associated with the hardness level of the synthesized negative triples, facilitating a more robust and effective learning procedure to distinguish between positive and negative triples. Extensive experiments on three MMKGC benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms several state-of-the-art MMKGC models and negative sampling techniques, illustrating the effectiveness of our DHNS for training MMKGC models.

How to Mitigate Information Loss in Knowledge Graphs for GraphRAG: Leveraging Triple Context Restoration and Query-Driven Feedback,"Manzong Huang, Chenyang Bu, Yi He, Xindong Wu","Abstract:Knowledge Graph (KG)-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently propelled significant advances in complex reasoning tasks, thanks to their broad domain knowledge and contextual awareness. Unfortunately, current methods often assume KGs to be complete, which is impractical given the inherent limitations of KG construction and the potential loss of contextual cues when converting unstructured text into entity-relation triples. In response, this paper proposes the Triple Context Restoration and Query-driven Feedback (TCR-QF) framework, which reconstructs the textual context underlying each triple to mitigate information loss, while dynamically refining the KG structure by iteratively incorporating query-relevant missing knowledge. Experiments on five benchmark question-answering datasets substantiate the effectiveness of TCR-QF in KG and LLM integration, where itachieves a 29.1% improvement in Exact Match and a 15.5% improvement in F1 over its state-of-the-art GraphRAG competitors.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15378,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Information Retrieval (cs.IR)
Who's Driving? Game Theoretic Path Risk of AGI Development,Robin Young,"Abstract:Who controls the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) might matter less than how we handle the fight for control itself. We formalize this ""steering wheel problem"" as humanity's greatest near-term existential risk may stem not from misaligned AGI, but from the dynamics of competing to develop it. Just as a car crash can occur from passengers fighting over the wheel before reaching any destination, catastrophic outcomes could arise from development competition long before AGI exists. While technical alignment research focuses on ensuring safe arrival, we show how coordination failures during development could drive us off the cliff first.
We present a game theoretic framework modeling AGI development dynamics and prove conditions for sustainable cooperative equilibria. Drawing from nuclear control while accounting for AGI's unique characteristics, we propose concrete mechanisms including pre-registration, shared technical infrastructure, and automated deterrence to stabilize cooperation. Our key insight is that AGI creates network effects in safety: shared investments become more valuable as participation grows, enabling mechanism designs where cooperation dominates defection. This work bridges formal methodology and policy frameworks, providing foundations for practical governance of AGI competition risks.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15280,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)
Abstraction Method for Generalized Planning with Baggable Types,"Hao Dong, Zheyuan Shi, Hemeng Zeng, Yongmei Liu","Abstract:Generalized planning is concerned with how to find a single plan to solve multiple similar planning instances. Abstractions are widely used for solving generalized planning, and QNP (qualitative numeric planning) is a popular abstract model. Recently, Cui et al. showed that a plan solves a sound and complete abstraction of a generalized planning problem if and only if the refined plan solves the original problem. However, existing work on automatic abstraction for generalized planning can hardly guarantee soundness let alone completeness. In this paper, we propose an automatic sound and complete abstraction method for generalized planning with baggable types. We use a variant of QNP, called bounded QNP (BQNP), where integer variables are increased or decreased by only one. Since BQNP is undecidable, we propose and implement a sound but incomplete solver for BQNP. We present an automatic method to abstract a BQNP problem from a classical planning instance with baggable types. The basic idea for abstraction is to introduce a counter for each bag of indistinguishable tuples of objects. We define a class of domains called proper baggable domains, and show that for such domains, the BQNP problem got by our automatic method is a sound and complete abstraction for a generalized planning problem whose instances share the same bags with the given instance but the sizes of the bags might be different. Thus, the refined plan of a solution to the BQNP problem is a solution to the generalized planning problem. Finally, we implement our abstraction method and experiments on a number of domains demonstrate the promise of our approach.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15249,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
A Causality-aware Paradigm for Evaluating Creativity of Multimodal Large Language Models,"Zhongzhan Huang, Shanshan Zhong, Pan Zhou, Shanghua Gao, Marinka Zitnik, Liang Lin","Abstract:Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts. this https URL",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15147,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)
A New Approach for Knowledge Generation Using Active Inference,"Jamshid Ghasimi, Nazanin Movarraei","Abstract:There are various models proposed on how knowledge is generated in the human brain including the semantic networks model. Although this model has been widely studied and even computational models are presented, but, due to various limits and inefficiencies in the generation of different types of knowledge, its application is limited to semantic knowledge because of has been formed according to semantic memory and declarative knowledge and has many limits in explaining various procedural and conditional knowledge. Given the importance of providing an appropriate model for knowledge generation, especially in the areas of improving human cognitive functions or building intelligent machines, improving existing models in knowledge generation or providing more comprehensive models is of great importance. In the current study, based on the free energy principle of the brain, is the researchers proposed a model for generating three types of declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge. While explaining different types of knowledge, this model is capable to compute and generate concepts from stimuli based on probabilistic mathematics and the action-perception process (active inference). The proposed model is unsupervised learning that can update itself using a combination of different stimuli as a generative model can generate new concepts of unsupervised received stimuli. In this model, the active inference process is used in the generation of procedural and conditional knowledge and the perception process is used to generate declarative knowledge.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15105,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Data Center Cooling System Optimization Using Offline Reinforcement Learning,"Xianyuan Zhan, Xiangyu Zhu, Peng Cheng, Xiao Hu, Ziteng He, Hanfei Geng, Jichao Leng, Huiwen Zheng, Chenhui Liu, Tianshun Hong, Yan Liang, Yunxin Liu, Feng Zhao","Abstract:The recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence have fueled a rapid expansion of the data center (DC) industry worldwide, accompanied by an immense appetite for electricity to power the DCs. In a typical DC, around 30~40% of the energy is spent on the cooling system rather than on computer servers, posing a pressing need for developing new energy-saving optimization technologies for DC cooling systems. However, optimizing such real-world industrial systems faces numerous challenges, including but not limited to a lack of reliable simulation environments, limited historical data, and stringent safety and control robustness requirements. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework for energy efficiency optimization of DC cooling systems. The proposed framework models the complex dynamical patterns and physical dependencies inside a server room using a purposely designed graph neural network architecture that is compliant with the fundamental time-reversal symmetry. Because of its well-behaved and generalizable state-action representations, the model enables sample-efficient and robust latent space offline policy learning using limited real-world operational data. Our framework has been successfully deployed and verified in a large-scale production DC for closed-loop control of its air-cooling units (ACUs). We conducted a total of 2000 hours of short and long-term experiments in the production DC environment. The results show that our method achieves 14~21% energy savings in the DC cooling system, without any violation of the safety or operational constraints. Our results have demonstrated the significant potential of offline RL in solving a broad range of data-limited, safety-critical real-world industrial control problems.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15085,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Feedback-Aware Monte Carlo Tree Search for Efficient Information Seeking in Goal-Oriented Conversations,"Harshita Chopra, Chirag Shah","Abstract:The ability to identify and acquire missing information is a critical component of effective decision making and problem solving. With the rise of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) systems, strategically formulating information-seeking questions becomes crucial and demands efficient methods to guide the search process. We introduce a novel approach to adaptive question-asking through a combination of Large Language Models (LLM) for generating questions that maximize information gain, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for constructing and leveraging a decision tree across multiple samples, and a hierarchical feedback mechanism to learn from past interactions. We present two key innovations: (1) an adaptive MCTS algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation for efficient search over potential questions; and (2) a clustering-based feedback algorithm that leverages prior experience to guide future interactions. Each incoming sample is assigned to a cluster based on its semantic similarity with previously observed samples. Our UCT (Upper Confidence bound for Trees) formulation selects optimal questions by combining expected rewards, a function of information gain, with a cluster-specific bonus that decays with depth, to emphasize the importance of early-stage questions that have proven effective for narrowing the solution space in similar samples. Experiments across three domains, including medical diagnosis and troubleshooting, demonstrate that our method leads to an average of 12% improvement in success rates and a 10x reduction in the average number of LLM calls made per conversation for the search process, in comparison to the state of the art.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15056,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)

Pre-trained protein large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on protein sequence generation. However, to control sequence generation for specific attributes, existing work still exhibits poor functionality and structural stability. In this paper, we propose a novel controllable protein design method called CtrlProt. We finetune a protein LLM with a new multi-listwise preference optimization strategy to improve generation quality and support multi-attribute controllable generation. Experiments demonstrate that CtrlProt can meet functionality and structural stability requirements effectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both single-attribute and multi-attribute protein sequence generation.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15007,"Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)"
What if Eye...? Computationally Recreating Vision Evolution,"Kushagra Tiwary, Aaron Young, Zaid Tasneem, Tzofi Klinghoffer, Akshat Dave, Tomaso Poggio, Dan Nilsson, Brian Cheung, Ramesh Raskar","Abstract:Vision systems in nature show remarkable diversity, from simple light-sensitive patches to complex camera eyes with lenses. While natural selection has produced these eyes through countless mutations over millions of years, they represent just one set of realized evolutionary paths. Testing hypotheses about how environmental pressures shaped eye evolution remains challenging since we cannot experimentally isolate individual factors. Computational evolution offers a way to systematically explore alternative trajectories. Here we show how environmental demands drive three fundamental aspects of visual evolution through an artificial evolution framework that co-evolves both physical eye structure and neural processing in embodied agents. First, we demonstrate computational evidence that task specific selection drives bifurcation in eye evolution - orientation tasks like navigation in a maze leads to distributed compound-type eyes while an object discrimination task leads to the emergence of high-acuity camera-type eyes. Second, we reveal how optical innovations like lenses naturally emerge to resolve fundamental tradeoffs between light collection and spatial precision. Third, we uncover systematic scaling laws between visual acuity and neural processing, showing how task complexity drives coordinated evolution of sensory and computational capabilities. Our work introduces a novel paradigm that illuminates evolutionary principles shaping vision by creating targeted single-player games where embodied agents must simultaneously evolve visual systems and learn complex behaviors. Through our unified genetic encoding framework, these embodied agents serve as next-generation hypothesis testing machines while providing a foundation for designing manufacturable bio-inspired vision systems.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15001,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE); Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)

Causal Graphs Meet Thoughts: Enhancing Complex Reasoning in Graph-Augmented LLMs,"Hang Luo, Jian Zhang, Chujun Li","Abstract:In knowledge-intensive tasks, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine and law, it is critical not only to retrieve relevant information but also to provide causal reasoning and explainability. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements.

Symbolic Knowledge Extraction and Injection with Sub-symbolic Predictors: A Systematic Literature Review,"Giovanni Ciatto, Federico Sabbatini, Andrea Agiollo, Matteo Magnini, Andrea Omicini","Abstract:In this paper we focus on the opacity issue of sub-symbolic machine learning predictors by promoting two complementary activities, namely, symbolic knowledge extraction (SKE) and injection (SKI) from and into sub-symbolic predictors. We consider as symbolic any language being intelligible and interpretable for both humans and computers. Accordingly, we propose general meta-models for both SKE and SKI, along with two taxonomies for the classification of SKE and SKI methods. By adopting an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) perspective, we highlight how such methods can be exploited to mitigate the aforementioned opacity issue. Our taxonomies are attained by surveying and classifying existing methods from the literature, following a systematic approach, and by generalising the results of previous surveys targeting specific sub-topics of either SKE or SKI alone. More precisely, we analyse 132 methods for SKE and 117 methods for SKI, and we categorise them according to their purpose, operation, expected input/output data and predictor types. For each method, we also indicate the presence/lack of runnable software implementations. Our work may be of interest for data scientists aiming at selecting the most adequate SKE/SKI method for their needs, and also work as suggestions for researchers interested in filling the gaps of the current state of the art, as well as for developers willing to implement SKE/SKI-based technologies.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14836,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)
RelightVid: Temporal-Consistent Diffusion Model for Video Relighting,"Ye Fang, Zeyi Sun, Shangzhan Zhang, Tong Wu, Yinghao Xu, Pan Zhang, Jiaqi Wang, Gordon Wetzstein, Dahua Lin","Abstract:Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation and editing, with recent advancements enabling albedo-preserving image relighting. However, applying these models to video relighting remains challenging due to the lack of paired video relighting datasets and the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency, further complicated by the inherent randomness of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we introduce RelightVid, a flexible framework for video relighting that can accept background video, text prompts, or environment maps as relighting conditions. Trained on in-the-wild videos with carefully designed illumination augmentations and rendered videos under extreme dynamic lighting, RelightVid achieves arbitrary video relighting with high temporal consistency without intrinsic decomposition while preserving the illumination priors of its image backbone.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16330,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
sDREAMER: Self-distilled Mixture-of-Modality-Experts Transformer for Automatic Sleep Staging,"Jingyuan Chen, Yuan Yao, Mie Anderson, Natalie Hauglund, Celia Kjaerby, Verena Untiet, Maiken Nedergaard, Jiebo Luo","Abstract:Automatic sleep staging based on electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals is an important aspect of sleep-related research. Current sleep staging methods suffer from two major drawbacks. First, there are limited information interactions between modalities in the existing methods. Second, current methods do not develop unified models that can handle different sources of input. To address these issues, we propose a novel sleep stage scoring model sDREAMER, which emphasizes cross-modality interaction and per-channel performance. Specifically, we develop a mixture-of-modality-expert (MoME) model with three pathways for EEG, EMG, and mixed signals with partially shared weights. We further propose a self-distillation training scheme for further information interaction across modalities. Our model is trained with multi-channel inputs and can make classifications on either single-channel or multi-channel inputs. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the existing transformer-based sleep scoring methods for multi-channel inference. For single-channel inference, our model also outperforms the transformer-based models trained with single-channel signals.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16329,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Evaluating The Performance of Using Large Language Models to Automate Summarization of CT Simulation Orders in Radiation Oncology,"Meiyun Cao, Shaw Hu, Jason Sharp, Edward Clouser, Jason Holmes, Linda L. Lam, Xiaoning Ding, Diego Santos Toesca, Wendy S. Lindholm, Samir H. Patel, Sujay A. Vora, Peilong Wang, Wei Liu","Abstract:Purpose: This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance.
Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution. A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries. The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites. For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries. The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists. The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference.
Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy. Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries. This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16309,Medical Physics (physics.med-ph); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Large Models in Dialogue for Active Perception and Anomaly Detection,"Tzoulio Chamiti, Nikolaos Passalis, Anastasios Tefas","Abstract:Autonomous aerial monitoring is an important task aimed at gathering information from areas that may not be easily accessible by humans. At the same time, this task often requires recognizing anomalies from a significant distance or not previously encountered in the past. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages the advanced capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively collect information and perform anomaly detection in novel scenes. To this end, we propose an LLM based model dialogue approach, in which two deep learning models engage in a dialogue to actively control a drone to increase perception and anomaly detection accuracy. We conduct our experiments in a high fidelity simulation environment where an LLM is provided with a predetermined set of natural language movement commands mapped into executable code functions. Additionally, we deploy a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) model charged with the task of visual question answering and captioning. By engaging the two models in conversation, the LLM asks exploratory questions while simultaneously flying a drone into different parts of the scene, providing a novel way to implement active perception. By leveraging LLMs reasoning ability, we output an improved detailed description of the scene going beyond existing static perception approaches. In addition to information gathering, our approach is utilized for anomaly detection and our results demonstrate the proposed methods effectiveness in informing and alerting about potential hazards.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16300,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Mixture-of-Mamba: Enhancing Multi-Modal State-Space Models with Modality-Aware Sparsity,"Weixin Liang, Junhong Shen, Genghan Zhang, Ning Dong, Luke Zettlemoyer, Lili Yu","Abstract:State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequential modeling, but their inability to leverage modality-specific features limits their performance in multi-modal pretraining. Here, we propose Mixture-of-Mamba, a novel SSM architecture that introduces modality-aware sparsity through modality-specific parameterization of the Mamba block. Building on Mixture-of-Transformers (W. Liang et al. arXiv:2411.04996; 2024), we extend the benefits of modality-aware sparsity to SSMs while preserving their computational efficiency. We evaluate Mixture-of-Mamba across three multi-modal pretraining settings: Transfusion (interleaved text and continuous image tokens with diffusion loss), Chameleon (interleaved text and discrete image tokens), and an extended three-modality framework incorporating speech. Mixture-of-Mamba consistently reaches the same loss values at earlier training steps with significantly reduced computational costs. In the Transfusion setting, Mixture-of-Mamba achieves equivalent image loss using only 34.76% of the training FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. In the Chameleon setting, Mixture-of-Mamba reaches similar image loss with just 42.50% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale, and similar text loss with just 65.40% of the FLOPs. In the three-modality setting, MoM matches speech loss at 24.80% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. Our ablation study highlights the synergistic effects of decoupling projection components, where joint decoupling yields greater gains than individual modifications. These results establish modality-aware sparsity as a versatile and effective design principle, extending its impact from Transformers to SSMs and setting new benchmarks in multi-modal pretraining.

Upside Down Reinforcement Learning with Policy Generators,"Jacopo Di Ventura, Dylan R. Ashley, Francesco Faccio, Vincent Herrmann, Jürgen Schmidhuber","Abstract:Upside Down Reinforcement Learning (UDRL) is a promising framework for solving reinforcement learning problems which focuses on learning command-conditioned policies. In this work, we extend UDRL to the task of learning a command-conditioned generator of deep neural network policies. We accomplish this using Hypernetworks - a variant of Fast Weight Programmers, which learn to decode input commands representing a desired expected return into command-specific weight matrices. Our method, dubbed Upside Down Reinforcement Learning with Policy Generators (UDRLPG), streamlines comparable techniques by removing the need for an evaluator or critic to update the weights of the generator. To counteract the increased variance in last returns caused by not having an evaluator, we decouple the sampling probability of the buffer from the absolute number of policies in it, which, together with a simple weighting strategy, improves the empirical convergence of the algorithm. Compared with existing algorithms, UDRLPG achieves competitive performance and high returns, sometimes outperforming more complex architectures. Our experiments show that a trained generator can generalize to create policies that achieve unseen returns zero-shot. The proposed method appears to be effective in mitigating some of the challenges associated with learning highly multimodal functions. Altogether, we believe that UDRLPG represents a promising step forward in achieving greater empirical sample efficiency in RL.

Brain-Adapter: Enhancing Neurological Disorder Analysis with Adapter-Tuning Multimodal Large Language Models,"Jing Zhang, Xiaowei Yu, Yanjun Lyu, Lu Zhang, Tong Chen, Chao Cao, Yan Zhuang, Minheng Chen, Tianming Liu, Dajiang Zhu","Abstract:Understanding brain disorders is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising approach to interpreting medical images with the support of text descriptions. However, previous research has primarily focused on 2D medical images, leaving richer spatial information of 3D images under-explored, and single-modality-based methods are limited by overlooking the critical clinical information contained in other modalities. To address this issue, this paper proposes Brain-Adapter, a novel approach that incorporates an extra bottleneck layer to learn new knowledge and instill it into the original pre-trained knowledge. The major idea is to incorporate a lightweight bottleneck layer to train fewer parameters while capturing essential information and utilize a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) strategy to align multimodal data within a unified representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in integrating multimodal data to significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy without high computational costs, highlighting the potential to enhance real-world diagnostic workflows.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16282,Image and Video Processing (eess.IV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)
What is Formal Verification without Specifications?

However, formulating specifications remains a manual task that is notoriously challenging and error-prone. To address this bottleneck in formal verification, recent research has thus focussed on automatically generating specifications for formal verification from examples of (desired and undesired) system behavior. In this survey, we list and compare recent advances in mining specifications in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), the de facto standard specification language for reactive systems. Several approaches have been designed for learning LTL formulas, which address different aspects and settings of specification design. Moreover, the approaches rely on a diverse range of techniques such as constraint solving, neural network training, enumerative search, etc. We survey the current state-of-the-art techniques and compare them for the convenience of the formal methods practitioners.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16274,Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)
Return of the Encoder: Maximizing Parameter Efficiency for SLMs,"Mohamed Elfeki, Rui Liu, Chad Voegele","Abstract:The dominance of large decoder-only language models has overshadowed encoder-decoder architectures, despite their fundamental efficiency advantages in sequence processing. For small language models (SLMs) - those with 1 billion parameters or fewer - our systematic analysis across GPU, CPU, and NPU platforms reveals that encoder-decoder architectures achieve 47% lower first-token latency and 4.7x higher throughput compared to decoder-only models on edge devices. These gains may be attributed to encoder-decoder's one-time input processing and efficient separation of understanding and generation phases.
We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables encoder-decoder models to leverage capabilities from large scalable decoder-only teachers while preserving their architectural advantages, achieving up to 6 average performance points improvement across diverse tasks, with significant gains in asymmetric sequence tasks where input and output distributions can benefit from different processing approaches.
When combined with modern advances like Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and Vision encoders, our systematic investigation demonstrates that encoder-decoder architectures provide a more practical path toward deploying capable language models in resource-constrained environments. Our findings challenge the prevailing trend toward decoder-only scaling, showing that architectural choices become increasingly crucial as parameter budgets decrease, particularly for on-device and edge deployments where computational efficiency is paramount.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16273,Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)
From Molecules to Mixtures: Learning Representations of Olfactory Mixture Similarity using Inductive Biases,"Gary Tom, Cher Tian Ser, Ella M. Rajaonson, Stanley Lo, Hyun Suk Park, Brian K. Lee, Benjamin Sanchez-Lengeling","Abstract:Olfaction -- how molecules are perceived as odors to humans -- remains poorly understood. Recently, the principal odor map (POM) was introduced to digitize the olfactory properties of single compounds. However, smells in real life are not pure single molecules, but complex mixtures of molecules, whose representations remain relatively under-explored. In this work, we introduce POMMix, an extension of the POM to represent mixtures. Our representation builds upon the symmetries of the problem space in a hierarchical manner: (1) graph neural networks for building molecular embeddings, (2) attention mechanisms for aggregating molecular representations into mixture representations, and (3) cosine prediction heads to encode olfactory perceptual distance in the mixture embedding space. POMMix achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance across multiple datasets. We also evaluate the generalizability of the representation on multiple splits when applied to unseen molecules and mixture sizes. Our work advances the effort to digitize olfaction, and highlights the synergy of domain expertise and deep learning in crafting expressive representations in low-data regimes.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16271,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)

Language-Based Bayesian Optimization Research Assistant (BORA),"Abdoulatif Cissé, Xenophon Evangelopoulos, Vladimir V. Gusev, Andrew I.

These complex, high-dimensional searches can be defined by non-convex optimization landscapes that resemble needle-in-a-haystack surfaces, leading to entrapment in local minima. Contextualizing optimizers with human domain knowledge is a powerful approach to guide searches to localized fruitful regions. However, this approach is susceptible to human confirmation bias and it is also challenging for domain experts to keep track of the rapidly expanding scientific literature. Here, we propose the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for contextualizing Bayesian optimization (BO) via a hybrid optimization framework that intelligently and economically blends stochastic inference with domain knowledge-based insights from the LLM, which is used to suggest new, better-performing areas of the search space for exploration. Our method fosters user engagement by offering real-time commentary on the optimization progress, explaining the reasoning behind the search strategies. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic benchmarks with up to 15 independent variables and demonstrate the ability of LLMs to reason in four real-world experimental tasks where context-aware suggestions boost optimization performance substantially.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16224,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
UDBE: Unsupervised Diffusion-based Brightness Enhancement in Underwater Images,"Tatiana Taís Schein, Gustavo Pereira de Almeira, Stephanie Loi Brião, Rodrigo Andrade de Bem, Felipe Gomes de Oliveira, Paulo L. J. Drews-Jr","Abstract:Activities in underwater environments are paramount in several scenarios, which drives the continuous development of underwater image enhancement techniques. A major challenge in this domain is the depth at which images are captured, with increasing depth resulting in a darker environment. Most existing methods for underwater image enhancement focus on noise removal and color adjustment, with few works dedicated to brightness enhancement. This work introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach to underwater image enhancement using a diffusion model. Our method, called UDBE, is based on conditional diffusion to maintain the brightness details of the unpaired input images. The input image is combined with a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation map (SNR) to ensure stable training and prevent color distortion in the output images. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate in the datasets UIEB, SUIM and RUIE, well-established underwater image benchmarks. Additionally, the experiments validate the robustness of our approach, regarding the image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, and UISM, indicating the good performance of the brightness enhancement process.

Raiders of the Lost Dependency: Fixing Dependency Conflicts in Python using LLMs,"Antony Bartlett, Cynthia Liem, Annibale Panichella","Abstract:Fixing Python dependency issues is a tedious and error-prone task for developers, who must manually identify and resolve environment dependencies and version constraints of third-party modules and Python interpreters. Researchers have attempted to automate this process by relying on large knowledge graphs and database lookup tables. However, these traditional approaches face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies. This study explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically fix dependency issues in Python programs. We introduce PLLM (pronounced ""plum""), a novel technique that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help an LLM infer Python versions and required modules for a given Python file. PLLM builds a testing environment that iteratively (1) prompts the LLM for module combinations, (2) tests the suggested changes, and (3) provides feedback (error messages) to the LLM to refine the fix. This feedback cycle leverages natural language processing (NLP) to intelligently parse and interpret build error messages. We benchmark PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a collection of challenging single-file Python gists. We compare PLLM against two state-of-the-art automatic dependency inference approaches, namely PyEGo and ReadPyE, w.r.t. the ability to resolve dependency issues. Our results indicate that PLLM can fix more dependency issues than the two baselines, with +218 (+15.97%) more fixes over ReadPyE and +281 (+21.58%) over PyEGo. Our deeper analyses suggest that PLLM is particularly beneficial for projects with many dependencies and for specific third-party numerical and machine-learning modules.

The Linear Attention Resurrection in Vision Transformer,Chuanyang Zheng,"Abstract:Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently taken computer vision by storm. However, the softmax attention underlying ViTs comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering the application of ViTs to high-resolution images. We revisit the attention design and propose a linear attention method to address the limitation, which doesn't sacrifice ViT's core advantage of capturing global representation like existing methods (e.g. local window attention of Swin). We further investigate the key difference between linear attention and softmax attention. Our empirical results suggest that linear attention lacks a fundamental property of concentrating the distribution of the attention matrix. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a local concentration module to enhance linear attention. By incorporating enhanced linear global attention and local window attention, we propose a new ViT architecture, dubbed L$^2$ViT. Notably, L$^2$ViT can effectively capture both global interactions and local representations while enjoying linear computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of L$^2$ViT. On image classification, L$^2$ViT achieves 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label. By further pre-training on ImageNet-22k, it attains 87.0% when fine-tuned with resolution 384$^2$.

To this end, we present BAG, a Body-aligned Asset Generation method to output 3D wearable asset that can be automatically dressed on given 3D human bodies. This is achived by controlling the 3D generation process using human body shape and pose information. Specifically, we first build a general single-image to consistent multiview image diffusion model, and train it on the large Objaverse dataset to achieve diversity and generalizability. Then we train a Controlnet to guide the multiview generator to produce body-aligned multiview images. The control signal utilizes the multiview 2D projections of the target human body, where pixel values represent the XYZ coordinates of the body surface in a canonical space. The body-conditioned multiview diffusion generates body-aligned multiview images, which are then fed into a native 3D diffusion model to produce the 3D shape of the asset. Finally, by recovering the similarity transformation using multiview silhouette supervision and addressing asset-body penetration with physics simulators, the 3D asset can be accurately fitted onto the target human body. Experimental results demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods in terms of image prompt-following capability, shape diversity, and shape quality.

To address this, we develop Taylor approximations that preserve key theoretical quantitative properties while reducing computational overhead.

While these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly across languages due to uneven training data distribution. Existing approaches using machine translation, and extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes through intermediary ""thinking languages"" before generating target-language responses. AdaCoT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining.

Toward Efficient Generalization in 3D Human Pose Estimation via a Canonical Domain Approach,"Hoosang Lee, Jeha Ryu","Abstract:Recent advancements in deep learning methods have significantly improved the performance of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). However, performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source and target domains remains a major challenge to generalization, necessitating extensive data augmentation and/or fine-tuning for each specific target domain. To address this issue more efficiently, we propose a novel canonical domain approach that maps both the source and target domains into a unified canonical domain, alleviating the need for additional fine-tuning in the target domain. To construct the canonical domain, we introduce a canonicalization process to generate a novel canonical 2D-3D pose mapping that ensures 2D-3D pose consistency and simplifies 2D-3D pose patterns, enabling more efficient training of lifting networks. The canonicalization of both domains is achieved through the following steps: (1) in the source domain, the lifting network is trained within the canonical domain; (2) in the target domain, input 2D poses are canonicalized prior to inference by leveraging the properties of perspective projection and known camera intrinsics. Consequently, the trained network can be directly applied to the target domain without requiring additional fine-tuning. Experiments conducted with various lifting networks and publicly available datasets (e.g., Human3.6M, Fit3D, MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves generalization capability across datasets while using the same data volume.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16146,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)

To address this, we propose stepwise task augmentation and relation learning (STAR), a strategy inspired by human reasoning. STAR constructs auxiliary data to learn quadruple relationships incrementally by augmenting with pairwise and overall relation tasks derived from training data. By encouraging the model to infer causal relationships among sentiment elements without requiring additional annotations, STAR effectively enhances quad prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed STAR exhibits superior performance on four benchmark datasets.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16093,Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
PISCO: Pretty Simple Compression for Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Maxime Louis, Hervé Déjean, Stéphane Clinchant","Abstract:Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents, but they face scalability issues due to high inference costs and limited context size. Document compression is a practical solution, but current soft compression methods suffer from accuracy losses and require extensive pretraining. In this paper, we introduce PISCO, a novel method that achieves a 16x compression rate with minimal accuracy loss (0-3%) across diverse RAG-based question-answering (QA) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PISCO requires no pretraining or annotated data, relying solely on sequence-level knowledge distillation from document-based questions. With the ability to fine-tune a 7-10B LLM in 48 hours on a single A100 GPU, PISCO offers a highly efficient and scalable solution. We present comprehensive experiments showing that PISCO outperforms existing compression models by 8% in accuracy.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16075,Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Information Retrieval (cs.IR)
